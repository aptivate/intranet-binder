    This is really confusing, but helps reduce code duplication. You have
    been warned: be prepared for head-spinning.
    
    A number of monkeypatch helper functions (before, after, patch...)
    do the same thing, so it's abstracted out here: they behave differently
    depending on whether external_replacement_function is None or not.
    
    If external_replacement_function is None, the monkeypatch helper is
    being used as a decorator for an external replacement function (the
    actual monkey patch code) which is not yet known, so the helper returns
    a no-argument decorator which then decorates the monkey patch
    (the final_decorator). For example:
    
        @after(MyClass, 'do_something')
        def after_MyClass_do_something_add_monkeys(*args, **kwargs):
            monkeys++
    
    If external_replacement_function is provided, the monkeypatch helper is
    being used as a procedure, to permanently replace a function or method
    with a monkeypatched version that involves the external_replacement_function
    in some way (before, after or around the original_function), or as a
    context object for a "with" statement, which undoes the patching when
    it finishes. We handle that by always returning a context object (a
    TemporaryPatcher) and if it's discarded (procedural style) then the
    patch is never undone and is permanent. In the context of a "with"
    statement, the TemporaryPatcher's __exit__ method undoes the patch when
    the statement exits.
    
    An example of procedural use: 
    
        def after_MyClass_do_something_add_monkeys(*args, **kwargs):
            monkeys++
        after(MyClass, 'do_something', after_MyClass_do_something_add_monkeys)
        
    An example of use in a "with" statement (temporary patching):
        
        with after(MyClass, 'do_something', after_MyClass_do_something_add_monkeys):
            MyClass().do_something()

    The monkeypatch helpers use this function (get_decorator_or_context_object)
    to decorate their own wrapper_function, which encapsulates what's unique
    about them: in what order, and with what arguments, they run the
    external_replacement_function and the original_function.
    
    The wrapper function is curried to receive two additional parameters, and
    patched over the target class method or module function. The additional
    parameters, which go before the arguments that the original_function is
    called with, are: (1) the undecorated external_replacement_function; and
    (2) the original_function, that was replaced by the monkey patch.
    
    THIS method is only ever used as an argumented decorator, so always returns
    a raw_decorator that takes only one argument, the monkeypatch helper's
    wrapper_function, which is to be decorated.

    Replaces one method (or module-level function) with another.
    The replacement does not have the same spec as the method it replaces:
    it is passed one additional argument, the original (replaced)
    function/method, as its first argument. This allows you to easily
    call the replaced method surrounded by extra code.
    
    Example:
    
    Use as a simple function:
    
    def replacement_foo(original_function, bar, baz):
        try:
            return original_function(bar, baz)
        except Exception as e:
            frob(e)
    import my.module.name
    patch(my.module.name, 'foo', replacement_foo)
    
    Use as a decorator:
    
    import my.module.name
    @patch(my.module.name, 'foo')
    def replacement_foo(original_function, bar, baz):
        try:
            return original_function(bar, baz)
        except Exception as e:
            frob(e)
            
    Replacing methods works exactly the same as functions. Note that the
    "self" argument comes second in the replacement:
    
    from my.module.name import MyClass
    @patch(MyClass, 'frob')
    def replacement_frob(original_function, self, bar, baz):
        try:
            return original_function(self, bar, baz) + 1
        except Exception as e:
            frob(e)
            
    The name of the replacement function/method doesn't matter much,
    but it will appear in stack traces, so you may want to use the name
    to describe what your replacement adds to the original, or removes
    from it:
    
    * foo_with_exception_handling
    * bar_without_call_for_last_orders
    
    You can also use the result as a context object:
    
        def frob_with_vitamin_c(original_function, *args, **kwargs):
            kwargs['frobbed'] = True
            return original_function(*args, **kwargs)
        with patch(MyClass, 'frob', frob_with_vitamin_c):
            MyClass().frob('hello')
    
    This will automatically undo the patch when the "with" block exits.
